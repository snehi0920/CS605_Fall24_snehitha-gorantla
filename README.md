The python code is a simple calculator that has user input option to select from six mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, logarithm and square root. The user can select an operation by entering a corresponding number from 1-6. 

The user can enter two float values if they select operations between 1 and 4 which are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Operations 5 and 6 are logarithm and square root respectively, hence allowing the user to enter one float value.

For division, the code checks where the denominator (second value entered) is zero or not and if the value is zero, it prints an error message. Similarly, for logarithm and square root, the given value should be a non-negative number.
